# GitHub Repository Cloning Script

This script automates the task of cloning all your personal GitHub repositories and those from your organizations, except specific ones you choose to exclude. It organizes them neatly into separate folders for each organization, simplifying the management of your GitHub projects.

## Features
- **Automated Cloning**: Clone all your personal and organizational repositories with a single command.
- **Organized Structure**: Automatically creates and organizes repositories in separate directories based on organization names.
- **Selective Cloning**: Excludes specific organizations, such as 'venveo', from the cloning process.

## Prerequisites
- Bash shell (Unix/Linux/Mac)
- `curl` and `jq` command-line tools
- GitHub Personal Access Token stored in a `.env` file

## Setup
1. Create a `.env` file in the same directory as the script with the following content:
   ```
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
   GITHUB_USER=your_github_username
   ```
2. Ensure the script is executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x cloner.sh
   ```

## Usage
Run the script in your terminal:
```bash
./cloner.sh
```
